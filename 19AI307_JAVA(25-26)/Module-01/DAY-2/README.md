# Ex.No:1(B) CONDITIONAL STATEMENT

## QUESTION:

A pirate ship has a code lock that only opens if:

1)The input code is even, and

2)If it is less than 100, say "Weak Code".

3)If it is between 100 and 999, say "Strong Code".

4)If the code is odd, deny access.

## AIM:

To write a Java program that accepts a code number and determines the security level based on the given conditions:

- If the code is even and less than 100 → Display "Weak Code"
- If the code is even and between 100 and 999 → Display "Strong Code"
- Otherwise → Display "Access Denied"

## ALGORITHM :

1.Start

2.Read an integer value code from the user.

3.Check if code is even (code % 2 == 0):
          
            If yes:
          
            If code < 100, display "Weak Code".
           
            Else if code is between 100 and 999, display "Strong Code".
          
            Else, display "Access Denied".
          
            If no, display "Access Denied".
           
4.Stop

        int code = sc.nextInt();
        if (code % 2 == 0) {
            if (code < 100) {
                System.out.println("Weak Code");
            } else if (code >= 100 && code <= 999) {
                System.out.println("Strong Code");
            }
            else
            {
                System.out.println("Access Denied");
            }
        } else
        {
            System.out.println("Access Denied");
        }
